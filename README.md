## About Me

I have over five years of experience working with both nonprofit and public agencies to advance sustainability and equity in our communities. I currently work part-time with the 501(c)3 research nonprofit Three<sup>3</sup> as a data analyst and research associate, where my work focuses largely on quantifying the health and financial benefits of improved energy efficiency and climate resilience in homes. In addition to this work, I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Public Policy, Management, and Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am helping to lead development on an open-access asset mapping tool for community development. I have contributed to research on health benefits resulting from low-income residential weatherization throughout the Southeastern, Midwestern, and Northeastern United States in studies funded by the JPB Foundation, Massachusetts Utility Program Administrators, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. I have also led qualitative interviews with refugees to assess their unmet needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and mapped affordable housing throughout the region to support local refugee services in placing refugees into housing.

## What I Hope to Learn

I hope to learn new analytic techniques to uncover research insights through mapping and GIS. This may include ways of visualzing and analyzing data within ArcGIS, as well as methods for geospatial data collection in the field. I would like to become more comfortable with creating maps for public consumption, including optimal symbology and visualization for non-technical audiences, such as story maps and other online publications. I hope to refine and polish my skills to become a more confident GIS professional, capable of delivering projects from start to finish and handing off products to external organizations in a way that is sustainable and will be helpful into the future.
